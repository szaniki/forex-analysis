# Forex Trend Analysis 

There are 180 different kinds of official currencies in the world. However, most international forex trades and payments are made using the U.S. Dollar, British Pound, Japanese Yen and the Euro so my project follows this trend and mainly focuses on the British Pound. This project was aimed to build machine learning models to predict the foreign exchange market by reviewing and analysing the past 2 decades.


## Details  
   
LSTM, Long Short-Term Memory and ARIMA, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average time series models were used to make prediction modelts.

This project was carried out purely for eductional purposes, in which circumstances it does not serve as suggestion when to invest or when to buy.

### Folders and files

- **CSV's.** All the CSVâ€™s used on the project. 
- **Images.** All the graphes obtained during the analysis, plus one image downloaded from Google.
- **Jupyter notebooks.** Each saved with informative names based on the segment of project they represent.
- **Movement Plots.** Repository for all the plots I did, check them out to see the evolution of colour usage through time. ???? 
- **Presentation.pptx** Presentation based on the graphes plotted duing the analysis, plus the output of my time series analysis - deep learning machine learning model.
