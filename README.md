# Forex Trend Analysis 

There are 180 different kinds of official currencies in the world. However, most international forex trades and payments are made using the U.S. Dollar, British Pound, Japanese Yen and the Euro so my project follows this trend and mainly focuses on the British Pound. This project was aimed to build machine learning models to predict the British Pound's rate on the foreign exchange market by reviewing and analysing the past 2 decades.


## Deep learning models:

Two different time series models were used to analyse historical financial data collected through Yahoo Finance API.
   
- LSTM, Long Short-Term Memory 

- ARIMA, AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average 


## Developer instructions

This project was carried out purely for eductional purposes, in which circumstances it does not serve as suggestion when to invest or when to buy. Future improvement could be achieved by extending the scope of analysis to different currency pairs, targeting further economic shock periods and involving further time series models (e.g. Prophet) to achieve more accurate financial predicitons. 

### Folders and files

- **CSV's.**: Some of the dataframes accessed from the API during the project have been saved as CSV. 
- **Images.** The most relevant graphs obtained during the analysis, plus one image downloaded from Google.
- **Jupyter notebooks.** Each saved with informative names based on the segment of project they represent.
- **Presentation.pptx** Presentation based on the graphes plotted duing the analysis, plus the output of my time series analysis - deep learning machine learning model. 

## Tools

- Python
